      <td> <p> It follows the principle “Write Once, Run Anywhere”, meaning programs written in Java can run on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Today, Java is maintained by Oracle Corporation and is widely used for developing web, mobile, and enterprise applications.</p></td>

        <td> <p> Java is designed to be simple and easy to understand. Its syntax is clean and similar to C and C++, but it eliminates complex features like pointers, operator overloading, and multiple inheritance, which makes programming less error-prone.</p></td>
      <td> <img src="Images/java.webp" align="center" width="100px" alt=""></td>
      <td> <p> Java is a purely object-oriented language, where everything is treated as an object. It supports major OOP concepts such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction, making programs modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.</p></td>

         <td><img src="Images/java.webp" align="center" width="100px" alt=""></td>
        <td> <p> One of Java’s greatest strengths is its platform independence. Java programs are compiled into an intermediate form called bytecode, which can run on any operating system that supports the JVM. This makes Java programs highly portable and suitable for cross-platform development.</p></td>
      <td> <img src="Images/java.webp" align="center" width="100px" alt=""></td>
      <td> <p> Java provides a high level of security by eliminating the use of pointers and supporting features like bytecode verification and access control. It runs programs inside a secure sandbox environment, preventing unauthorized access to system resources.</p></td>
